# Marketing Strategy Optimization

This project was a part of MIT's course 15.093 Optimization Methods.

The project aims to design a framework for optimizing a marketing strategy given a fixed budget, multiple marketing options, and varying constraints and optimization goals. Four marketing options are included here: Targeted Online Advertising, E-mail, Print Media, and Influencer Marketing. However, the frameworks and formulations we provide can be easily extended to fit any combination of marketing options.
